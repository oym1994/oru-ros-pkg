This stack contains packages related to 3D perception, in particular 3D point cloud registration. For more details check [perception](perception.md) page.

# grasping stack #

This stack contains packages related to Independent Contact Regions (ICR) generation and grasping. For more details check the [grasping](grasping.md) page.

# navigation stack #
